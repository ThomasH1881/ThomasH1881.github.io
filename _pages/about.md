I am a second-year PhD student at UW-Madison. I work in [Wisconsin NetLab](https://madnets.cs.wisc.edu/) and my advisor is [Prof. Ming Liu](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mgliu/). My research interests focus on exploring distributed underlying computer systems with emerging network devices.

_I am actively looking for an intership during summer 2024._
