I am a second-year PhD student at UW-Madison. I work in [Wisconsin NetLab](https://madnets.cs.wisc.edu/) and my advisor is [Prof. Ming Liu](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mgliu/). My research interests focus on networking and systems. More recently, I have been building FPGA-based acceleration systems for composable infrastructures.
<br/>
I also build and maintain testbeds. It's a lot of fun (and bugs).
